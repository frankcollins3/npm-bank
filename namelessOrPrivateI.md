`problem:`
besides sending pictures, no way to allow employers to see iterations of current (private repo & project) which is a startup attempt
basically include generals & exclude specifics but can't. 
cant or maybe shouldn't show exact data tables | data fetching resolvers but willing to share nearly everything else

`proposed approach`
make a separate repo titled: "startup issues" and just copy the issues over.

`me`
hey does github have a preference wherein: 
private repo 
but non-private commit titles and commit-extended-descriptions?

`ChatGPT`
Hey! GitHub doesn't natively support a setting where commit titles and descriptions from a private repository are publicly visible while keeping the rest of the repository private. Commits in a private repository are fully private along with the rest of the content.

If you want to share commit information while keeping the code private, you could consider alternative approaches such as:

#### Manually Sharing Commits: 
Regularly extract and publish commit messages to a public space, such as a public repository or a website.

#### Webhook or Automation: 
Use a webhook or a continuous integration tool to automatically post commit messages to a public place whenever a commit is made.
Would you like to explore one of these methods further, or do you have a different idea in mind?
